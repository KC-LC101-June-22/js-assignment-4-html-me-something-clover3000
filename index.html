            I've been collecting a large assortment of fun items since I was a child. Amassing a large variety in shapes, sizes, colors, formats, etc. I've came to reach a fondness for kitsch and the tchochkies that come along with it. While most of it is decorative, there are a few things that serve a bit more function. Within this page you will learn all about it :- )

         <h2>Garfield</h2>
         <p>
            One of the first things that I started collecting was Garfield in all options. It started at a young age when I had saw Garfield(2004) in theaters. My mom took me to a toy store and I had purchased my very first plush! Since then any time I go to any thrift store, he is the first thing that I keep an eye out for. I have amassed a sizable collection of plush, comics, and vhs tapes in the time that has passed.

         <h2>Assorted Plush and Figures</h2>
         <p>
            Along the way from various sources, primarily seeing things I think are cute or funny online or at thrift stores, I have also achieved a sizable collection of other knick knacks from a multitude of sources. Examples of such are Monchhichi, Sanrio's PomPomPurin, and miscellaneous toys that I have gotten out of claw machines. 
            Living in 4 states has given me a large variety of environments to go thrift shopping, so most of my collections have been purchased in real life.

         <h2>It's Media!</h2>
         <p>
            I've also managed to acquire a variety of media. Ranging from biographies to comics to DVDs to VHS tapes, I have a whole variety of things to keep me occupied! Some of my favorite pieces in this collection are the VHS copy of Over the Garden Wall that was being produced in a limited run by an artist that I've followed for years, vintage Japanese fashion magazines, and a variety of Godzilla VHS tapes as well.
